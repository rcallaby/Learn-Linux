#Using GREP â€“ Some Useful Examples

There are many great applications of the program GREP. GREP is a command that relies primarily on regular expressions to gain the most power from its use.

For instance you can use the following:
```
    sudo grep -I err /var/log/messages
```

This searches for the err string with ignoring case in the /var/log/messages directory.
