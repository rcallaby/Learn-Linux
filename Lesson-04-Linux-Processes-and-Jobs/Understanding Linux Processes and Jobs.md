# **Understanding Linux Processes and Jobs**

In Linux, **processes** and **jobs** are fundamental to system operation. A **process** is a running instance of a program, while a **job** is a task managed by the shell. This guide focuses on the most common use cases, with practical command-line examples.

## **1. Understanding Linux Processes**
A process is an execution of a program with its own unique **Process ID (PID)**. Linux supports **foreground**, **background**, and **daemon** processes.

### **1.1 Viewing Running Processes**
To examine running processes, use the following commands:

#### **`ps` (Process Snapshot)**
- View user processes:
  ```bash
  ps
  ```
- View all system processes:
  ```bash
  ps aux
  ```
- View processes in a hierarchical (tree) format:
  ```bash
  ps -ef --forest
  ```
- Find a specific process:
  ```bash
  ps aux | grep apache2
  ```

#### **`top` (Dynamic Process Monitoring)**
- Display real-time process information:
  ```bash
  top
  ```
- Exit `top`: Press `q`
- Sort by memory usage: Press `M`
- Sort by CPU usage: Press `P`

#### **`htop` (Enhanced `top`)**
- If not installed, install it:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install htop  # Debian-based
  sudo yum install htop  # RHEL-based
  ```
- Run it:
  ```bash
  htop
  ```

## **2. Managing Processes**
### **2.1 Starting a Process**
- Run a command normally (foreground):
  ```bash
  nano file.txt
  ```
  This blocks the terminal until `nano` exits.

### **2.2 Running a Process in the Background**
- Append `&` to run a process in the background:
  ```bash
  firefox &
  ```
- Check background processes:
  ```bash
  jobs
  ```

---

## **3. Controlling Foreground and Background Jobs**
### **3.1 Suspending a Process**
- Press `Ctrl + Z` to suspend a foreground job.

### **3.2 Moving a Suspended Job to the Background**
- After suspending, use:
  ```bash
  bg
  ```
  or specify a job number (from `jobs` output):
  ```bash
  bg %1
  ```

### **3.3 Bringing a Background Job to the Foreground**
- Bring the last background job to the foreground:
  ```bash
  fg
  ```
- Bring a specific job to the foreground:
  ```bash
  fg %2
  ```

## **4. Killing Processes**
### **4.1 Killing a Process by PID**
- Find the process PID:
  ```bash
  ps aux | grep myprocess
  ```
- Kill it:
  ```bash
  kill 1234
  ```
- Force kill:
  ```bash
  kill -9 1234
  ```

### **4.2 Killing a Process by Name**
- Kill all instances of a process:
  ```bash
  pkill firefox
  ```
- Force kill all instances:
  ```bash
  pkill -9 firefox
  ```

### **4.3 Killing Jobs**
- Use `jobs` to find the job number:
  ```bash
  jobs
  ```
- Kill the job:
  ```bash
  kill %1
  ```

## **5. Monitoring and Managing Process Priorities**
### **5.1 Viewing Process Priority (`nice` Value)**
Each process has a **nice value** (priority) between `-20` (highest priority) and `19` (lowest priority):

- View process priorities:
  ```bash
  ps -eo pid,comm,nice,%cpu --sort=-%cpu
  ```

### **5.2 Changing Process Priority**
- Start a process with a lower priority:
  ```bash
  nice -n 10 myscript.sh
  ```
- Change priority of a running process:
  ```bash
  renice -n -5 -p 1234
  ```

## **6. Process and Job Persistence**
### **6.1 Using `nohup` to Keep Processes Running**
- Run a process that ignores hangups (keeps running after logout):
  ```bash
  nohup python3 myscript.py &
  ```
- Redirect output:
  ```bash
  nohup python3 myscript.py > output.log 2>&1 &
  ```

### **6.2 Using `disown` to Detach Jobs**
- Detach a job from the terminal:
  ```bash
  disown -h %1
  ```

---

## **7. Advanced Process Control**
### **7.1 Using `screen`**
Allows running persistent terminal sessions:
- Start a screen session:
  ```bash
  screen -S mysession
  ```
- Detach from a session: `Ctrl + A`, then `D`
- List sessions:
  ```bash
  screen -ls
  ```
- Reattach to a session:
  ```bash
  screen -r mysession
  ```

### **7.2 Using `tmux`**
Similar to `screen` but more modern:
- Start `tmux`:
  ```bash
  tmux
  ```
- Detach: `Ctrl + B`, then `D`
- List sessions:
  ```bash
  tmux ls
  ```
- Attach:
  ```bash
  tmux attach-session -t 0
  ```

## **8. Automating and Scheduling Processes**
### **8.1 Using `cron` for Scheduled Tasks**
- Edit the crontab:
  ```bash
  crontab -e
  ```
- Schedule a job:
  ```bash
  0 3 * * * /home/user/backup.sh
  ```
  (Runs `backup.sh` at 3 AM daily)

### **8.2 Using `at` for One-Time Jobs**
- Schedule a command:
  ```bash
  at 14:00
  ```
  Then enter the command to run at 2 PM.

- View scheduled jobs:
  ```bash
  atq
  ```
