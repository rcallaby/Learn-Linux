<strong>Putting it all together</strong>

Everything learned in this course so far has lead to this moment. Essentially, all of the commands, tools and so on can be automated or streamlined by creating BASH scripts.

This section is devoted to putting all what is learned in this course in this “capstone” or final part of the course.
Learning how to use scripting in Linux truly unleashes its power.

Bash scripting is a way for you or anyone to perform complex tasks with just one or two commands as opposed to potentially 10 to 20 commands.

Clearly, the best way for you to distinguish yourself at work or even at your home is to not do any extra work than what is necessary.

Learning how to create even the most simple bash scripts can greatly help you become far more efficient.

Bash Scripting is a key part of any Linux Administrators job, so therefore you will be tested on it when you are applying for a network admin job that has Linux servers as part of their network.

The idea of this section is to wrap up all of the key features and parts that I covered in this course.
With the ability to use cron jobs and bash scripting you should be able to streamline a lot of mundane tasks.

Now, obviously I can’t know or predict how you will benefit from this information. There are always outliers in any group so please keep that in mind. You may have needs that I simply cannot prepare for but you should learn how to create bash scripts that can perform most of the tasks that you will need to perform in a week.

If you know that you perform a job or a task repeatedly then it would benefit you to create a script for it, just so that you can eliminate as much of the keystrokes as possible.

You should always be striving to get faster and more efficient at your job.

In order to make this course the best it could be it may be helpful to tell me what scripts you find to be the most useful.
While I will try and predict what tasks you should try to automate there may be instances where I may have missed.

If you tell me what scripts make your job more efficient that would give me an opportunity to create additional examples of those scripts so that everyone can benefit.

Anyways, I hope you found this course to be helpful and I especially hope you find this ending section to be the most useful.
