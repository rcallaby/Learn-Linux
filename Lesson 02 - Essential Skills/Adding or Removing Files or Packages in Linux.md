<strong>Adding or Removing Files or Packages in Linux</strong>

When using Linux there are a variety of methods of adding or removing packages or programs. The manner in which you do these tasks differs depending upon what type of Linux operating system plus what ever package management system you choose to use. Since there are many different types of package management systems and each one has their own quriks and features I will just focus on the apt package management system in this part of the tutorial.

One thing to note here is that in order to update, install, or remove a package from your Linux system you will need to make sure you have sudo privileges to do so. You can check what your privileges are in sudo by using the following command:

```
    sudo -l
```

The first thing you will want to do in apt is to make sure you are using the most up to date packages. To do this in apt it is quite simple you would simply just use the following command:

```
    sudo apt-get update
```

Altrnatively, you could just use the followig command as apt-get can be a bit redundant:
```
    sudo apt update
```

To upgrade your system the command would be very similar to the update command as follows:
```
    sudo apt-get upgrade
```

You can also just upgrade a single package or program by using the following:
```
    sudo apt-get upgrade [packagename]
```
Of course, the brackets are not necessary but rather just use the name of the package you wish to install.

Now, there are times when you may need to upgrade everything in your system. That includes the drivers, the kernel, and so on. To do so you would need to do a full upgrade of your Linux operating system.

```
    sudo apt-get full-upgrade
```
To install a invidual package you would use the following command:
```
    sudo apt-get install [packagename]
```
Or alternatively, you can install multiple packages by just simply listing them on a single line such as the following:
```
    sudo apt-get install [package1 package2 package3]
```
As well, you can download packages for a debian based system that have a .deb extension on the filename. In order to install these packages you would use the following command:
```
    sudo apt-get install /path/to/file.deb
```

To remove a package the command to do so is very easy and very similar to the install command. You can do so using the following command:
```
    sudo apt remove [packagename]
```
You can remove multiple packages using this same command such as the following:
```
    sudo apt remove [package1 package2 package3]
```

You can remove packages that are no longer needed and have no dependencies. This helps to clear up space and can also help secure your system as unused packages can have vulnerabilies that can be exploited by some nafarious hackers.

To do so you would use the following command:
```
    sudo apt autoremove
```
If you wish to find out what packages you have on your system you could use the following command:
```
    sudo apt list
```
This will list all of the packages on the system, including those that haven't been fully installed.

To get a listing of all packages that have been installed you would use the following command:
```
    sudo apt list --upgradeable
```
If you wish to find a package on your system that is a pretty easy task to do with the apt package management system:
```
    sudo apt search [packagename]
```
Finally, you can find out information regarding a package by using the apt show command such as the following:
```
    sudo apt show [packagename]
```

This should give you some idea of how to use the apt package management system in a Debian based operating system. There are more package management systems available and some package management systems are based upon different types of Linux operating systems. It does take time to learn them all but once you do then you will have a lot more control over your operating system than before.
