# Essential Linux Commands to Get you Started Quickly

These are some of the most commonly used Linux commands you will use on a daily basis. This is essentially a quick start guide to help you begin to understand the basics of Linux.

This list isn’t supposed to be comprehensive but it is supposed to help you get rapidly started.

### The ls command

The ls command helps you by telling you what is in the directory
An example would be as follows:
```
    ls
```

<b>The pwd command</b>

The pwd command signifies your present working directory. It really doesn't take any arguments but tells you your location in the file system using the terminal.
An example would be the following:
```
    pwd
```

<b>The cd command</b>
The cd command is short for change directory, it how you can navigate in the command line such as:
```
    cd <directoryname>
```
<b>The mkdir command</b>
mkdir command will create a new directory in the current location or you can specify a location where you want the directory to be made such as:
```
    mkdir <directoryname>
```
<b>The rmdir command</b>
rmdir will delete the directory you specify. It must be empty for this to work so you may have to use some other additional commands in order to use this one. You can use it as following:
```
    rmdir <directoryname>
```
<b>The touch command</b>
touch command is used to create a blank new file such as:
```
    touch <filename>
```

<b>The sudo command</b>
Sudo perhaps one of the more important commands you should know. Sudo allows you to perform tasks as a “super user” or an admin priviledge. Such as:
```
    sudo rm -r <directoryname>
```
<b>The df command</b>

The df is a report on the system disk space usage such as:
```
    df
```
<b>The du command</b>

The du command is to check to see how much a file or directory takes, it is short for disk usage such as:
```
    du
```

<b>The head command</b>

The head command displays the first lines of any particular file. You will probably use this mostly with text documents such as:
```
    head <filename>
```
<b>The tail command</b>

The tail command is used to display the end lines of any particular file such as:
```
    tail <filename>
```
<b>The top command</b>

Top command is very much like the task manager in windows. This displays all of the running processes and how much CPU each process takes up such as:
```
    top
```
<b>The history command</b>

The history command displays all of the commands you have used in the past. You can search history by using another command such as grep. As well, you can clear the history by typing history -c such as:

```
    history -c
```

Much more detail regarding these commands and their use is within this course. However, these are some of the more commonly used commands or at least the commands that are the most useful in that they display the most useful information or are used the most often.
