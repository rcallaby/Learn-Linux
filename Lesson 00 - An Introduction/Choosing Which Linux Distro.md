# Choosing Which Linux Distro to use

Linux distributions are an individual choice. For some, choosing which Linux distribution you use determines your personality and individuality.

Choosing which Linux Distro to use depends upon a variety of factors
Now, some of these factors I cannot predict

For instance, if you are learning Linux to use in a corporate environment then that choice may have already been made for you.

An example would be if you are learning Linux because your company or business is using a particular distro already then you should really learn that distro first before others.

Many businesses use Red Hat Linux for example, and this course doesn’t really cover this distro in any meaningful depth.
However, even though this course doesn’t cover Red Hat Linux in depth you should be able to learn something from the course.

This course is teaching primarily Debian Linux distributions.
The reasons behind this is because the vast majority of consumer Linux distributions are Debian based.

Debian is a very consumer friendly version of the Linux distributions that are available.

You can really get into customization and personalization with Debian distributions as opposed to some of the other choices you may have.

### The Available Choices

In the Linux world there are really three major camps or flavors of Linux. They are Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora, and Arch based distributions. Typically, the Debian/Ubuntu and Fedora flavors are geared towards the beginner to intermediate Linux user. Whereas in the Arch community the Linux distribution is geared towards someone with a lot of experience.

The underlying architecture of each system is basically the same, at its core. All the Linux distributions all essentially use the same Linux commands in this course. There are key differences in how they manage packages, however, and each distribution has their own repository of packages that are tested and geared towards that distribution. There is no main central repository of packages available to all Linux distributions.

### Why choose Debian/Ubuntu Linux?

When looking for help with using Linux many of the questions and answers seem to be geared primarily towards a Debian/Ubuntu system. That is why I designed this course to be also geared in that manner. It is far easier to find answers for any difficulties you may encounter if you are using a Debian/Ubuntu system.

However, I do also recognize that it may be necessary to learn how Fedora and Arch based Linux systems work. With that in mind some of the lectures/tutorials may also have that information.

For instance, Linux differs in many cases in how packages are managed as I mentioned above. So, learning how each package management system works would benefit you as a end user and potential employee of a company.
